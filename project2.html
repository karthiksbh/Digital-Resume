            <p>Expense Track is a web application designed to help users(mainly students) manage and track their expenses effectively. The project consists of two components - the Expense Track Client and the Expense Track Server.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The Expense Track Client is built using React.js. It offers a user-friendly interface where users can securely register themselves, log in, add, and delete expenses. The client is designed with responsiveness in mind, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices.</li>
                <li>On the server side, the Expense Track Server is developed using Express.js . It provides a robust back-end infrastructure for handling user authentication, storing expense data in a MongoDB Database, and exposing RESTful APIs for seamless communication with the client. </li>
            </ul>

            <p>With Expense Track, users can gain valuable insights into their financial habits and conveniently manage their spending. </p>
