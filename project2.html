            <h1>Built an Ecommerce Website using Django Framework</h1>

            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/karthiksbh/EcommerceDjango">Source code</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Tech Stack Used: Django, HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQLite</strong></p>
            
            <p>The project includes an online shopping web application which provides the users with a list of products available for purchase & helps in purchasing them. The application allows the users to login to their account, place order, view their orders, add reviews on the products etc. </p>

            <ul>
                <li>For the front end, I have used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and some basic JavaScript.</li>
                <li>For the backend, I have used Django Framework and SQLite Database to store the respective data. </li>
                <li>The main objective of this project was to learn about the backend functionality, databases and to understand how this server-side application is integrated with the client-side website.</li>
            </ul>
